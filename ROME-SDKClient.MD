# ROME SDK - Agent Orchestration Framework

## Introduction
The **Agent Swarm Protocol** (ROME-SDK) provides a powerful toolkit for integrating rAgents with diverse resources and orchestrating them in scalable multi-agent ecosystems. By combining advanced resource-sharing capabilities with robust communication layers, it simplifies building swarms of agents that can operate both independently and collaboratively.

As industries increasingly rely on distributed systems, the demand for effective agent collaboration grows. This protocol ensures smooth and reliable operations by providing mechanisms for peer-to-peer communication, secure resource sharing, automated discovery, and fault tolerance. With the Agent Swarm Protocol, organizations can create self-sustaining ecosystems where agents autonomously coordinate tasks, manage workloads, and recover from failures, contributing to a highly resilient and efficient system.

### Key Benefits of the Agent Swarm Protocol

- **Decentralization:** Removes reliance on central controllers, enabling agents to operate independently.
- **Resilience:** Built-in fault tolerance ensures that agents can self-heal and adapt to failures.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Optimized resource sharing reduces operational costs by making efficient use of available assets.
- **Security:** Cryptographic verification mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and ensure trust among agents.
- **Interoperability:** Supports a wide range of applications, from cloud computing to IoT and AI systems.

### Objectives of the Agent Swarm Protocol

1. **Efficient Communication:**
    - Enable real-time messaging with minimal latency.
    - Support direct, relayed, and broadcast communication models.

2. **Resource Optimization:**
    - Facilitate the sharing of computing power, storage, and network bandwidth.
    - Dynamic resource allocation to balance workload.

3. **Security & Trust:**
    - Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.
    - Provide reputation scoring to establish trust between agents.

4. **Scalability:**
    - Seamless expansion to accommodate growing workloads and additional agents.
    - Efficient task distribution within swarms of varying sizes.

5. **Autonomy:**
    - Allow agents to make independent decisions based on predefined logic.
    - Self-monitoring and self-healing capabilities for improved reliability.

### Use Cases

The Agent Swarm Protocol has applications in various industries, including but not limited to:

- **Cloud Resource Allocation:**
    - Dynamic management and scaling of cloud-based computing resources.
    - Load balancing among agents based on demand.

- **Autonomous Fleet Coordination:**
    - Coordinated movement and decision-making for autonomous drones and vehicles.
    - Real-time route optimization and collision avoidance.

- **Decentralized AI Training:**
    - Enabling distributed machine learning where agents contribute processing power.
    - Secure data sharing while maintaining privacy compliance.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @rome-sdk/core @rome-sdk/agents @rome-sdk/swarm
```
## 🔧 Quick Start
### 1. Create an Agent

```typescript
import { Agent, AgentConfig } from '@rome-sdk/agents';
import { Swarm, SwarmConfig } from '@rome-sdk/swarm';

const config: AgentConfig = {
  id: 'agent-001',
  capabilities: ['compute', 'storage'],
  resources: {
    maxMemory: '1GB',
    maxCPU: 2
  }
};

const agent = new Agent(config);
await agent.initialize();
```
### 2. Form a Swarm
```typescript
const swarmConfig: SwarmConfig = {
  name: 'processing-swarm',
  minAgents: 3,
  maxAgents: 10,
  consensusStrategy: 'raft'
};

const swarm = new Swarm(swarmConfig);
await swarm.addAgent(agent);
```

### 3. Implement Communication
```typescript
// Subscribe to events
agent.on('message', async (message) => {
  console.log('Received:', message);
});

// Send message to another agent
await agent.sendMessage('agent-002', {
  type: 'TASK_ASSIGNMENT',
  payload: { taskId: 'task-001' }
});
```
## 🔐 Security Implementation
###  Authentication
```typescript
import { SecurityManager } from '@rome-sdk/core';

const security = new SecurityManager({
  encryption: 'AES-256',
  tokenValidity: '24h'
});

const token = await security.generateToken(agent.id);
```
### Capability Exchange
```typescript
// Grant capability
await agent.grantCapability('storage-access', {
  target: 'agent-002',
  duration: '1h',
  permissions: ['read', 'write']
});

// Use capability
await agent.useCapability('storage-access', {
  operation: 'write',
  data: buffer
});
```

## 📊 Resource Management

### Resource Sharing
``` typescript
// Share resources
await agent.shareResource({
  type: 'COMPUTE',
  amount: '500MB',
  target: 'agent-003',
  duration: '30m'
});

// Monitor usage
agent.on('resource-usage', (metrics) => {
  console.log('Current usage:', metrics);
});
```
## 🔄 Task Orchestration
### Task Distribution

```typescript
const task = new Task({
  id: 'task-001',
  type: 'DATA_PROCESSING',
  priority: 'HIGH',
  timeout: '5m'
});

await swarm.distributeTask(task, {
  strategy: 'round-robin',
  retries: 3
});
````
### Error Handling
``typescript
swarm.on('task-failed', async (taskId, error) => {
  const task = await Task.get(taskId);
  await swarm.redistributeTask(task, {
    excludeAgent: error.agentId
  });
});
```
## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

```typescript
const metrics = new MetricsCollector(swarm);

metrics.on('update', (stats) => {
  console.log('Swarm Statistics:', {
    activeAgents: stats.agents.active,
    completedTasks: stats.tasks.completed,
    resourceUtilization: stats.resources.utilization
  });
});
```
## 🔗 Integration Patterns

### External Service Integration
```typescript
import { ServiceConnector } from '@rome-sdk/core';

const database = new ServiceConnector({
  type: 'DATABASE',
  url: process.env.DB_URL,
  credentials: {
    username: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASS
  }
});

await agent.registerService(database);
```

### Event Streaming

```typescript
import { EventStream } from '@rome-sdk/core';

const stream = new EventStream({
  topic: 'agent-events',
  persistence: true,
  partitions: 3
});

await agent.connectToStream(stream);
```
## 📚 Advanced Configuration
### Custom Agent Behaviors
```typescript
class CustomAgent extends Agent {
  async onMessageReceived(message: Message) {
    // Custom message handling
  }

  async onResourceRequest(request: ResourceRequest) {
    // Custom resource handling
  }
}
```
## Swarm Policies
```typescript
const policy = new SwarmPolicy({
  scaling: {
    minAgents: 5,
    maxAgents: 20,
    scalingFactor: 1.5
  },
  resourceLimits: {
    maxMemoryPerAgent: '2GB',
    maxCPUPerAgent: 4
  },
  security: {
    requireEncryption: true,
    tokenRefreshInterval: '6h'
  }
});

await swarm.applyPolicy(policy);
```
